Student Status System (SSS) is a SAIS-inspired platform designed for the Department of Physical Sciences and Mathematics.
It efficiently manages student progress and support for extended absences, focusing on diverse degree programs like Applied
Physics, Biochemistry, and Computer Science. The system caters to faculty, staff, and admin roles, offering features such as 
student and faculty databases, class registration, and comprehensive reporting. Faculty members can monitor student records, 
generate predefined reports, and track academic progress, while staff members handle data entry tasks. The system ensures privacy
by segregating access rights for thesis and program advisers. With predefined reports and user-friendly interfaces, SSS streamlines
academic management and supports informed decision-making.
